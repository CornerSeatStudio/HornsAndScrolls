#### my god what hte fuck is version control anyways
#### good fucking luck figuring this shit out nerds
#### now with formatting  

## **Todo list for anyone honestly** 
- protoype an UI
- design a simple level
- use current storyboard and transform it into said level/other level

## **fun terms ive learned:**  
- Repository (Repo): All the history/changes to a project 
- Working Directory: Folder location (being the unity game location in this case) where the project lives on your computer 
- Commit: Basically a "save" - into the repo 
- Staging: What happens before a commit - choosing what specifically gets commited onto git 
- Push: From local to webserver 
- Pull: from web to local 
- Branch: an alternate "timeline" to work on featuers and not step on other's toes  
- Pull Request: when a branch is ready to be merged with the master, submit this and someone (probably me) will deal with the merge conflicts  

## **Rule of Law for branches**
- Master: only for FINAL and INDEFINITE features (basic code and shit)  

whenever you do something on your end, MAKE YOUR OWN BRANCH. Once you've finished commiting featuers to that branch and want it merged to the main game, PULL REQUEST
