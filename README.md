Repository (Repo): All the history/changes to a project \n
Working Directory: Folder location (being the unity game location in this case) where the project lives on your computer\n
Commit: Basically a "save" - into the repo\n
Staging: What happens before a commit - choosing what specifically gets commited onto git\n
Push: From local to webserver\n
Pull: from web to local\n
