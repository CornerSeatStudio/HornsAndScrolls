## **fun terms ive learned:**  
- Repository (Repo): All the history/changes to a project 
- Working Directory: Folder location (being the unity game location in this case) where the project lives on your computer 
- Commit: Basically a "save" - into the repo 
- Staging: What happens before a commit - choosing what specifically gets commited onto git 
- Push: From local to webserver 
- Pull: from web to local 
- Branch: an alternate "timeline" to work on featuers and not step on other's toes  
- Pull Request: when a branch is ready to be merged with the master, submit this and someone (probably me) will deal with the merge conflicts  

## **Rule of Law for branches**
- Master: only for FINAL and INDEFINITE features (basic code and shit)  
- Next: for all upcoming features in testing - completed features can be merged into the master via pull request  
- Testing: for testing random features we may wanna try or test away from everything else  
  
All testing features (if applicable) should be merged into the next branch, and all completed next features should be merged into the master branch
