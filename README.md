my god what hte fuck is version control anyways
good fucking luck figuring this shit out nerds


fun terms ive learned:

Repository (Repo): All the history/changes to a project

Working Directory: Folder location (being the unity game location in this case) where the project lives on your computer

Commit: Basically a "save" - into the repo

Staging: What happens before a commit - choosing what specifically gets commited onto git

Push: From local to webserver

Pull: from web to local

I have actually used this before for mods and shit

so basically put into projects what we have to do and what is done already.
